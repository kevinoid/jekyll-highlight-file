Installation Instructions
=========================

To install this plugin, simply place `highlight_file.rb` inside the `_plugins`
directory of the site for which the plugin will be used.

Configuration Instructions
==========================

The default values of the options to the highlight_file Liquid tag are
hard-coded at the top of `highlight_file.rb`.  It is possible to change these
defaults by editing this file.  If there is demand/interest, a future version
may load defaults from the site configuration (`config.yml`).
